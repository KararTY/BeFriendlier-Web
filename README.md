## Changelogs

* [Website](CHANGELOG.md)
* [Bot](https://github.com/KararTY/BeFriendlier-Bot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Shared](https://github.com/KararTY/BeFriendlier-Shared/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Setup

* `npm i` / `yarn i` / `pnpm i --shamefully-hoist` to install packages.
* Copy `.env.example`, to a new file named `.env`.
* Change the environment values in the new `.env` file.
* Check `config/` directory for other configurations to change. Default config values should be sufficient for development, however.
* If your `DB_CONNECTION` is not set to `sqlite`, make sure to create a database with the same name under `DB_NAME`.
* `npm run r:m:s` for seeding the database with initial values. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`, you will also get development values to test around with.
* `npm run dev` to start web server in watch mode (Reloads on file change) with debugging websocket enabled.
* Or alternatively `npm run build && npm start` to build & start web server in "production" mode (No reloading on file change and no debugging websocket). That's it.

## Contributing

* Use `ts-standard` for linting and code style:
  * Run `npm run lint` to check for formatting issues.
  * Run `npm run format` to fix formatting issues.
* Always create a new branch, it's recommended to not push to master.
* Issue a pull request. Pull requests are squashed into 1 commit.
* Pull requests should ***only introduce or fix one thing***.
* Use Conventional Commits specification for your commit messages. [Read more here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This project mostly make use of fix/feat/chore/docs/refactor.
* If you are creating a release in your own fork, run `npm run release`.
