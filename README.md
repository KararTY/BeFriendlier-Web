Looking to hook up with POG Twitch friends?

# Idea
Twitch "Tinder(TM)" bot.

# Execution
  * 10 minute cooldown for "swiping" command.
  * Swiping gives you a text, consisting of the user's bio and a selection of things they like.
  * You can reply to the bot with "yes" or "no" to try to match with the person.
  * Profile can be setup via command. Simple 15 word bio.
    Profiles can be setup to be global or channel-specific.
    Only one global profile.
    Only one profile per channel.
    Setup asks you a few questions to better "match" you with Twitch friends.
  * Profiles also accessible via web link, displaying user customized pictures.
  * Choose between global results and channel results.
  * On "match", users are whispered the user name of the person they matched with.

Stay tuned.
